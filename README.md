# WeatherAPI-.Net6
A primer to build a Web API in .NET 6. Requires Visual Studio 2022. Community edition will do.

### Motivation

To transition developers who have been building Web APIs using the .Net Framework (4-5-4.8) to .NET 6. These developers have missed the .Net Core phase. (This happens when getting a working software to market is more important than transitioning to new frameworks.)

New development will be in the .NET 6 space, and hence the primer.

### Why a Weather API?

Visual Studio creates a WeatherForecast API everytime you create a new ASP.NET Core Web API project. This outputs ridiculous values, quite understandable, as the focus is on the Program.cs file and incorporating Open API 3 specifications for documentation.

But it was inspiration to create a Weather API that would also focus on 'other things' that are required to create an API. It also returns real data.

Weather data is sourced from the World Meteorological Organization.
